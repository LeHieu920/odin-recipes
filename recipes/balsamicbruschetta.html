        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When summertime gives you perfectly ripe and juicy tomatoes, one of the best ways to enjoy them is also one of the easiest. Simply dice the tomatoes, season them with a touch of salt, add a generous amount of good quality olive oil, and spoon the mixture over thick slices of toasted or grilled bread. Congratulations - you've just made bruschetta. This 5-star recipe for Balsamic Bruschetta shows you how to bump up that basic tomato mixture with basil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, and Parmesan cheese; and how to toast the bread in the oven — a good alternative if you don't have a grill or the weather isn't grill-friendly</p>
        <p>Bruschetta (pronouced brew-SKET-tah) is an Italian appetizer or antipasti that starts with a base of toasted or grilled bread. The bread is then served warm either with a topping spooned over or with a topping on the side so each person can build their own bruschetta. Bruschetta is meant to be served as a hand-held finger food, large enough for one or two bites.</p>
